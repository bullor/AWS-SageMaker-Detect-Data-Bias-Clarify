-1,Cute in theory  i love the bright colors  the tied black collar sash and the 70's vibe  however  the fabric is cheap  and the worst part in my view is that the seams that run along the front center of the shirt do not align the pattern. maybe this was intentional  but with the shirt i received  it looked horrible. i sent it back. i notice in the picture that the black ties are strategically placed over the center front seam  so it is a bit deceiving. i wouldn't buy this top at any price based on,Blouses
-1,I got the blue. it is very short. one side of the shirt i received was shorter that the other. the material feels cheap and pleats out a bit right over the bust - only flattering on small busted models.,Blouses
-1,This shirt was just really missing something for me. i originally liked the patter of the small dots all over the fabric  especially with the sleeves being more sheer than the rest of the blouse. i also am tending to gravitate toward clothes that hide my residual baby fat in my midsection. however  the tie is very high up on the neck and it made me feel like i was wearing a turtleneck. i rarely wear turtle necks because they make me feel like i am choking. in addition  the bow seemed to be too t,Blouses
-1,This top is absolutely beautiful. the fabric is great  the cut is nice  etc... however  the buttons are too big for the button loops  which do not have any stretch. it took ten minutes to open the shirt to try it on. once i had it on  i left it unbuttoned. i returned it. (if you can't live without it  you could put smaller buttons on it.) too pricey for a non-functioning top. too bad.,Blouses
-1,"I ordered this online  and when i opened the package  i was impressed with the quality of the material and stitching for this top. it is much nicer than a basic t-shirt.    when i tried this on  the band of stitching that was supposed to go beneath my chest was sitting on top of my cleavage! also  the overall length is listed as 27"" long  but i think that is the back of the shirt. the front of the shirt is very short on me (i'm 5'10"")  hitting well above my hip bones.    if only this was much  m",Blouses
-1,This top was supposed to be 23 1/4 inches long in petite. it's actually 28 1/2 inches long.  it's also large in width. hard to believe it's an extra small petite.,Blouses
-1,This is a beautiful shirt. the back is a few inches longer than the front which makes for a cool effect.  the only thing that i didn't like about this shirt was how fragile the buttons on the back are. i was taking this shirt off and one popped off. when i went to hang it  another one popped off! so i had to return it. such a shame.,Blouses
-1,I ordered this shirt online and didn't even try it on... it is super see through and i would need to wear a tank underneath and i don't want to have that extra layer in the summer.  it is cute though!,Blouses
-1,It's sheer  the design /print is casual  but on silk like material. had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer???,Blouses
0,The color of this top is lovely. however  i felt the quality was lacking for the price. the fabric is thin and the top i tried on in the store had some loose threads already. fit was tts for me.,Blouses
0,So this is still a pretty cute shirt  but my xs is missing the ruffle in the front and has layers on the bottom front of shirt. it doesn't seem to be defective  just a different version of the shirt. i'm curious to find out from others if they have gotten the same shirt as i have. still deciding whether to keep or not. no more left in xs to place another order and see what's up. i do wish it had the ruffle in front  as that is what caught my eye.,Blouses
0,I'd been wanting the blouse for quite a while but hesitated based on reading reviews. when it went on sale i thought i'd try but it was like a tent on me. the fabric was pretty but just hung without any resemblance to photo. too bad because the color was gorgeous & could have been a favorite of looked like photo.,Blouses
0,I normally get a small in this style shirt but it didn't fit at all so i had to send it back. too bad,Blouses
0,Beautiful well made top.it just runs small not for me,Blouses
0,I bought this tank for work  but the color of the print is slightly muted compared to the photo. i usually wear a xxs or xs (i am 100 lbs  5'1) and i got the xs thinking it will be loose  which i wanted. the arm holes were down to my waist  and it was also unusually wide. the quality of the fabric is nice though  not to heavy and not too thin.,Blouses
0,I am totally on the fence with this shirt. like the other reviewers  i sized up because my normal 14 was too tight in the chest (a common problem for me). the arms are strangely tight and i didn't get much more room in the bust with the 16. but then the bottom of the shirt tents away and hangs funny. this is obviously meant for those with a very small bust who are on the slender side. i love the pattern and material though  so i'm going to visit my trusty seamstress and see if she can place dart,Blouses
0,I thought this top had shimmery dots  that is what it looks like in the picture. but when it arrived  it looks much plainer in-person and i could not believe it was this top. the dots are polka dots. the embroidery at the v-neck doesn't stand out much in the photo but it does in-person. the top runs true to size but the fit didn't feel as perfect for me. i am sending it back. i needed a more shimmery top.,Blouses
0,I love the fabric however the overall fit did not work for me.   i think the arms are much smaller than the overall shirt.,Blouses
1,I have been wanting to incorporate button down blouses into my wardrobe for months but hadn't found any that caught my eye. leave it to retailer to supply the best alternative to a classic look. i love everything from the bottom flare to the way it cinches my waist. i would say this is perfectly appropriate for a business setting while still giving you individual style.,Blouses
1,It's a cute top. i agree with the other poster that the neck in the front feels a little restrictive.,Blouses
1,Runs big so size down. i love this top for many reasons but armholes are big so went to xs and i am usually a small or medium. xs was perfect and still long enough for me. gorgeous fabric and color and flow. got tons of compliments! very feminine and comfy. looks great with jeans and white crops.,Blouses
1,This top is gorgeous in person! i'm in love with it! it's perfect for the holiday season. it runs a little big and long so i suggest going down a size for a more tailored fit.,Blouses
1,I ordered this because i can&#39;t resist denim shirts.  i love the unusual shape for a tank top and the full-length  bronze zipper in the back is to die for.  it looks great with everything!,Blouses
1,Thanks to the previous reviewer who noted the details and size of the blouse  i purchased this blouse. it's true to size  size small fit me perfectly (i'm 34b  26 waist  36 hips)  and it even fit my muscular arms and broad shoulders perfectly. the color is very rich  a wine color. some of the jars of jam have berries on it  and of course  the tassels have spoons at the end. the neckline is so perfect  feminine yet appropriate for work. how cute is that? it is a silky material and flows perfectly,Blouses
1,I found this blouse to be just a lovely spring and summer top. the netting in back adds interest and the dusky peach floral print is extremely pretty. the tiered layers add a slimming effect and it can be worn casual or for dress. it could even be worn in the fall with the right sweater. i just love it and feel so feminine when i wear it.,Blouses
1,Well  i totally disagree with the previous reviewer on this one! i think this top is very pretty. yes  it does hide any flaws in the tummy  but it is not wide nor does it make you look pregnant (side or front view). i am 5 ft  2 inches  broad shouldered  36c and the small fit nicely (i usually wear a small to medium in retailer tops). i am thinking of purchasing the xs as there is still plenty of room around the chest/arm area. the lace is pretty  looks good worn with a dark colored pant. the only,Blouses
1,This shirt is gorgeous. i bought it for my engagement party and got lots of compliments. the only thing negative was that the particular shirt i bought had one of the stones on the sleeve that the prongs were bent so it snagged the beautiful embroidery on the front of the shirt.. of course my local retailer exchanged it for a perfect new one without hassle. it's an expensive shirt but perfect for a special occasion.,Blouses
-1,I bought this dress for a holiday party  and the sequins on the dress were so much more blue that what it looks like in the photo. i still liked it  but when i went to try it on  it was just not working. i thought this was more of a loosely fitted look  but the upper bodice and waist seam are very tightly fitted. i would recommend sizing up  but be aware that the top straps (shoulder to breast) are too loose to begin with  so they may sag.  overall  i wouldn't recommend this dress for the curren,Dresses
-1,I was disappointed with the style and quality of this dress. it poofs out funny in the waste and it just looks very unflattering. i'm sending it back.,Dresses
-1,Too full of a dress for me. i tried a belt and it is then too chunky. if you are younger  tall and slim  this would look great,Dresses
-1,"This may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried. the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo  absolutely garish. the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties  it just looks cheap. the skirt is an antebellum nightmare.    i did not even want to try it on  it's that bad. i considered adding a photo  but was too horrified.  for reference  i'm 5'10""  approximately the height/ size of the model  but it was shorter than the photo depictes. i wanted to like it ",Dresses
-1,"I have a holding horses dress similar to this one from about a year ago.  i loved the swinging fit without it looking like a maternity dress.   the fit and style of this dress is wonderful  it's the color that killed it for me.   i ordered the ""orange"" because i liked the photo on the model.  when the dress arrived in the mail  i could hardly take it out of the package and try it on.   the color is almost neon orange.   too much for this redhead.  hard to wear that bright neony color.  not sure",Dresses
-1,Fabric is not as rich as shown in photo. dress much shorter than shown in photo. shoulder area is tight and really doesn't blend with the material below. this isn't going to work on very many people - pear shape...just not what i've come to expect from retailer.,Dresses
-1,Frumpy - looked like a nightgown on me; maybe  better on someone younger ...,Dresses
-1,I also returned this dress after waiting weeks to received it.  i had high hopes for this dress as i really loved it online but what a disappointment when i got it.  the fabric is made of cheap poly that's shiny  thin  and clingy.  it shows every lump and bump you have.  the zipper at the back won't lay flat and keeps bunching up creating an ugly bump.  the sewing and hemline is uneven.  there wasn't a lot of thought put in in the print placement where the seams was sewn together in the midline,Dresses
-1,I was really excited when i ordered this dress for na upcoming beach vacation but was very disappointed when i finally saw it in person. it reminded me of those christmas nightgowns from the 90s with the red and white ruffles. pass!,Dresses
0,I am on the fence about this dress. the fabric is gorgeous and soft. however  i was hoping the fit was more slouchy like pictures on the model. it was much shorter on me that pictured (for reference i am 5'7) and the turtle neck part of the dress is kind of high and tight. i wanted to love this so much  but it is a touch off from what i was hoping it was going to be.,Dresses
0,I wanted to love this  as it seemed like a fun and carefree take on a little black dress.    but how did i not see that this has tassels? but they're there  a whole row of them - look hear the bottom of the skirt part  between the colorful stripes and the lacy area. that's a deal breaker for me - i really can't stand the way these look  and they're not the sort of thing you can easily remove.    the fabric  though nice quality  has no stretch at all. i wasn't expecting stretch  but i'd just say,Dresses
0,I purchased this for a very good price and i typically love maeve... should have been a win-win. the fabric is thin and slinky in the most unfortunate way. it made finding appropriate undergarments very difficult. i had to add a slip (that helped) and figured that since i'm losing weight  it would look better when i'm down a few more pounds. that being said  i didn't find it to be figure flattering. i have a tummy and there was at least one photo from the bridal shower i wore this to  where i lo,Dresses
0,This dress did not work for me. i tried it in my bigger size 6 since i am coming off winter weight gain. the dress fit tts but was squishing the breasts like tight bandages. i have smaller chest and the stretch bodycon fabric of the bodice made me look flat-chested. the straps did not sit flat on shoulders  i assume because they were not pulled tight enough by the chest. the dress was uncomfortable and felt strange on. but i can see how others with more curves on top will love the support of the,Dresses
0,This is a lovely dress  but much more casual than i thought from the picture. the material is very thin and casual. i needed a dressier dress  and i didn't need another casual dress  so i sent it back  but it would be fine if you want something casual.,Dresses
0,This immediately caught my eye in the neutral pattern  and the fabric is actually quite nice. the fit is at least a size or two too large though  with the bust being way too large for me even sizing down. my normal 4 was big everywhere  and the 2 was still big in the chest  but fit everywhere else. the belt is handy for cinching in some of the loose areas  but the top section just didn't work for me. maybe better for someone better endowed?,Dresses
0,I like my clothes loose fitting but even for me this ran large  i am 5'7 134b and medium fit in the shoulders but was too big overall,Dresses
0,Super cute well made dress. runs very small. order at least two times your typical size.,Dresses
0,I'm normally between a 4-6 in retailer dresses. i had to go up to a size 10 just to get the buttons across the chest to close and lay properly without feeling like i would bust out. definitely not for those with any kind of chest.,Dresses
1,I purchased this beauty in the sophisticated dark green on black friday and it has been in constant rotation. it looks chic and classy  feels comfortable and warm. i only wish it was about 2 inches longer  i'm 5'5 and it hits at low thigh  i prefer just above the knee for a winter dress. very practical for walking around city all day and then being ready for a dinner or drinks in style. love it.,Dresses
1,I bought this dress to wear at a bridal shower and absolutely love it! the color was perfect and the petite-xs was true to its size. the top was a bit on the tight side with my arms but overall incredibly comfortable. i would buy more in this style and size  but not having enough occasions to wear the style. it's great for wedding guests  cocktail hours  or even work.,Dresses
1,"I bought this dress to wear to my graduation where i was receiving a degree in horticulture. i also just had a child a few weeks prior and was worried about sizing. the high waist worked well for the post pregnancy belly. i am 5'3"" and was typically around 130 lbs pre-pregnancy which was typically a 4 in dresses. i ordered a 6 petite in this dress and it was perfect! the only area that was sort of tight was the bosom but i am nursing so i expected as much. the petite length was perfect for my he",Dresses
1,The photos don't do the top of the dress justice; it's really gorgeous. however  it runs very large. i am going to exchange it for 1 or 2 sizes down.,Dresses
1,I ordered the xxs petite (only size in petite left at the tme0 and that was right for me. i usually (should say used t) get xs but with the looser styles lately  xxs seems to fit me better. hte leg hem falls below my knee  but not too low on the calf. the waist is comfortable  hte weird part is the fabric  the sash part seems to be lighter and the softer part is on the inside so it would seem.    for reference  i am 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist.,Dresses
1,What the picture doesn't show  is that there are pockets on the side seams that do add a bit to the hip area. also  the dress runs very large  in my opinion. i ordered a medium (my usual size) and everything was loose. i am going to exchange it for a small and hope the proportions stay the same because it's very pretty.  it is very boxy  and kind of nightgown looking when it's big  so if you wouldn't want it to cling a bit this might not be a good dress. the fabric is gorgeous and soft  but be a,Dresses
1,"I am so pleased with my purchase. the two different levels of the dress is just simply fun and unique. the attached matching  adjustable baby blue slip is a nice add. neither the dress or slip fit too tight or too loose around my torso. i ordered a small which fits me perfect and in case it is helpful  i am 5'7""  133  and a 36a.   if you have been considering this dress  don't delay  especially at the wonderful sale price!",Dresses
1,This dress has a really lovely design and is very  very comfortable. it is not quite as flattering as i had hoped  and doesn't have quite as defined a shape as i expected. still  it's cute and i'm happy to have it!,Dresses
1,There aren't enough great words to describe this dress. tried on the black one in store yesterday and knew immediately i was going to purchase.  everything is perfection - not tight slip underneath that even has the strap snap closures to hold it in place at the shoulders  not too low cut  hits right above knee so not too short  light weight  flattering  etc!!  and machine washable! can dress up or down. could even wear to work with a jacket or cardi. can wear all seasons - can't wait to pair wi,Dresses
-1,I agree with the other reviewer. the colors were fabulous  but it was boxy and fit me like a sack. the slits on the side really detracted from the cute fabric and the hood drooped way in the back due to being able to pull away from the slits. it was really a cute idea and i'm sad it didn't work. i started not to order it based on the first review but i wanted to give it a chance --i should have listened !,Fine gauge
-1,How cute was this little sweater and comfortable even in the south .... until i washed it! i followed the instructions on the label being careful not to wring it out. first of all  the smell was unbelievable! i washed it three days ago and it is still wet and damp and on top of that  it shrunk. even though i handwashed it  line dried it and pampered it to no end!,Fine gauge
-1,I was really excited about this sweater  but the fit was terrible. the sleeves were the right size  but the body of the sweater was a tent - absolutely no shape. they must have clipped the sweater on the model. for reference  i'm 5'4 and 120 pounds and ordered a size small.,Fine gauge

-1,Much to my surprise when i tried on this sweater i found that it was cut in a bell shape and not at all fitted or straight like in the photo. when i pulled it out of the package i thought i'd ordered the wrong size because the shoulders looked so narrow. but when i tried it on the shoulders fit perfectly  with beautiful detail and high quality material  but the sweater belling out to a very wide shape. it is very wide at the hip and looks out of proportion. it doesn't look anything like the phot,Fine gauge

-1,"The small  zipped and laid flat  measures 16"" across at the bottom of the armholes  11"" at the waist and 18"" from shoulder seam to bottom edge. it's too small for a size 0  and not by just a little! too bad  because it really is very pretty.",Fine gauge
-1,And not in a good way. everywhere i went  i left a little of this sweater behind. within hours of having it on  i was picking balls of fabric off the couch  bed  and the sweater itself looked like it was molting. great style  fabric and fit (although a little on the long side ) but there's no way i can keep it.,Fine gauge
0,Without seeing the 'online exclusive' notation  i went into my local retailer store to try on this sweater because sometimes i wear small and sometimes a medium. once the very helpful retailer employee looked it up and advised they don't carry it in stores  i ordered it at the check-out desk in a size medium. i was so excited with anticipation because i love stripes and i love the color gray... this sweater was right up my alley. i was very disappointed when i decided to return it. first of all  i d,Fine gauge

0,This is a very sweet/soft sweater  however it runs very large and is very boxy! i would say at least size down 1-2 sizes! i wanted to love them but i had to send it back!!,Fine gauge
0,This sweater looks soft and flowy on the model  but in the store it is rather stiff lace in the back and very plain in the front. i did not like the ribbing on the front bottom of the sweater because it pulled in places and didn't lie flat. way too expensive for what you are getting.,Fine gauge
0,I ended up returning it just because it didn't do much for my current postnatal figure  but otherwise this top is just so pretty and unique!,Fine gauge
0,So when i saw a sweater with a big llama face on the front of it  i knew it must be mine. i ordered it and eagerly awaited its arrival. while the llama print and color of the sweater are ah-mazing  the fit of the sweater leaves something to be desired. i'm a 36 dd and mostly a size l  so that's what i ordered. it wasn't snug  but it didn't have the cut to pull off the oversized drapey look  so the areas where it was loose looked...strange. the sleeves were really long too  but i could have rolle,Fine gauge
0,A few things: this runs very large. i'm usually a s/m (i'm a little busty so i sometimes size up!) and i'll definitely need an xs in this  i'm swimming in the small. the blue is definitely a steel blue/grey  not really navy. the material is very thin - i thought it would be a bit more substantial. it's very lightweight. that said  it's very pretty  i love the neckline which can be worn as a cowl neck or off the shoulder  and i'll give the xs a shot instead!,Fine gauge
0,This shirt is beautiful  however i thought that it was made of a softer  lighter material. it is  instead  made of a thick  heavy material that was unflattering for my shape. ( short torso ann's large bust) it made me look boxy and chunky in the middle. sadly  i'll be returning it.,Fine gauge
0,"I am about 5'6""  135 lbs and usually wear between a small or a medium. i ordered a small  as another reviewer did. right when i took it out of the packaging  i could see that it was going to be much shorter than you can tell from the online photo. i knew the sweater was going to be cropped  but it falls right at the top of my hip bones. when i raise my arms up  my whole midriff shows. did not flatter my athletic build at all. the fit around the shoulders and chest is fine  skimming but not tight",Fine gauge
1,I tried on the white top at the store. the quality was very good and i loved the overall concept of the design. the dark stripes on the back are slightly raised  giving it a nice texture. the fabric was soft and comfortable. however  the shape just didn't drape as well on me as i had hoped  so ultimately i didn't buy it. perhaps a petite length would have fit me better.,Fine gauge

1,Easy to wear and layer. thin and light casual fabric  not itchy. great basic addition to my closet!,Fine gauge
1,This cardigan caught my eye and i had no idea how soft and wonderful it would feel so it's a win-win! it hangs a little boxy so i'll need to figure out how to style it so it's more flattering. the pockets are a pretty gold color (you can see it from the inside) and adds a nice touch of color. it's a keeper!,Fine gauge
1,This sweater is light gray  as shown in the photo  not dark gray as the description states. i went up from my usual size so would say it runs small. it is lightweight enough that i think i will get adequate use out of it this winter in fl.,Fine gauge

1,So soft and pretty  but the fit is off on me. i'm an xs/0 and the seam on this hits right across my bust. with the 3/4 length sleeves it makes the whole thing look like it shrunk in the wash. on my pre-teen daughter however it looks perfect  so i guess i'd say size up if you have boobs!,Fine gauge

1,"Loved everything about this sweater but the short length.  didn't notice in the pictures but the last one of the back of the model shows the length. it barely reached the very top of my jeans so would have to wear something under or i'd be flashing my stomach all the time.  worked a bit better with skirts  but still too cropped for my frame. wish it was 1-2"" longer in length and would have been a new fall favorite. really great color and design besides that. just make sure you are wanting the sh",Fine gauge
-1,I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay  but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store  i would have passed over it. however  i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies  though!,Intimates

-1,3 tags sewn in  2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!,Intimates
-1,It seemed to stay in place and did not require constant readjustment. however  i found the band to be extremely small and tight. it is not the most comfortable bra because of the way the band just presses into your skin.,Intimates
-1,"Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me  if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also  for the price  material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i'm 5'2""  114#  34b",Intimates
0,It is a very pretty bra. light weight and beautiful lace. however  i have yet to find a t-back that does not make me feel like i am going to spill out. to me it ran small. i now know to get a 34 instead. i am working on losing weight  perhaps that might help with the fit?,Intimates
0,I ordered this in black and white  thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles.     i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory  not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality  however the fit is good  and true to size.,Intimates

0,I'm a 32-a  and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight  but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back  it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it  but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.  the quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape. i wish i could have made it work  because it was really comfortable. i returned it in the end.,Intimates
0,I wanted to love this set  but sadly it just didn't fit as i had hoped. the small was bigger than expected and looked frumpy and not sexy. returned.,Intimates
0,As a petite  big busted woman  i found this dress wildly unflattering. the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful  though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent. the design of the bust however  i found unflattering.,Intimates
0,I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors  but after only a few minutes of wearing them  i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28  and ordered these in a m  but i guess they were still too small  which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty  but i will not be ordering more.,Intimates

1,"Bought the black xs to go under the larkspur midi dress because they didn't bother lining the skirt portion (grrrrrrrrrrr).  my stats are 34a-28/29-36 and the xs fit very smoothly around the chest and was flowy around my lower half  so i would say it's running big.  the straps are very pretty and it could easily be nightwear too.  i'm 5'6"" and it came to just below my knees.",Intimates
1,"Beautiful pajama bottoms. i purchased these as a special treat for myself. luckily  i found a review on another site  stating that these run small  before pirchasing. no one wants tight pjs. order a size up! also  i'm 5'8"" tall and the length is just right. if you are taller  you may find this style too short. i haven't ordered the top  because i'm not sure of the fit  but i'm guessing it also runs small  based on the photo.",Intimates
1,This bra is everything. looks good and feels good. so happy with this purchase. for reference  i am a c cup and got a medium. i do have a little side boob action happening but i'm still happy with the fit of the medium,Intimates
1,Great piece just wish it fit a bit more blousy rather than cami,Intimates
1,I know it's a bit of a moot point since the chemise has sold out - but on the off chance any come back in stock  or if you see one at your local store - i urge you to try it on! the fabric is incredible. so luxurious. it fits me amazingly. i have a hard time with the whole tight chemise/slip/nightie category of clothing  as i'm fairly skinny  but still curvy  and while i love my curves  i do have a muffin top that can get real awkward when you're trying to look sexy. this  however  is a godsend.,Intimates
1,This bra is the one. i have been searching high and low to replace my worn out comfy bra  and this is it. if you are looking for a wireless bra with thin straps that can peek out from your shirt and not announce themselves as hello bra straps  a v-neck cut (none of that scoop cut nonsense)  and you don't care about trying to boost your cleavage  this bra has it all. so comfy too.,Intimates
1,"I purchased this in the black and received it today.  it is silky feeling and is a quality camisole.  the color is a muted black  not all shiny as some silks are (and they often look cheap) but this looks great and could be worn alone  under leather  or with a sweater/kimono.  i usually wear a medium in tops  and this fit true to size.  i am 5'2"" and it doesn't look too long  but i do wish it came in a petite.  still keeping it!",Intimates
-1,Love the idea of this top  but it is so thin and the sequins look so cheap. the quality reminds me of something you would buy for $20 at a market abroad. definitely disappointed with the quality for the price. will be retuning.,Jackets
-1,"This arrived this week and i was so disappointed. the proportions are all wrong--- from the empire waist to the dolman sleeves  to the weird texture added to the material. if i could sum up this jacket with one word it would be ""weird"".",Jackets
-1,This vest looked so cute online but it's a disaster. the quilting is so bulky that the drawstring doesn't work properly and it just hangs. itlooks like something out of a costume closet that could be used for a peasant farmhand or a zombie movie. seriously  it's bad.,Jackets
-1,I ordered this to wear for a holiday party hoping to have something unique and dressy. it was too bulky at the shoulders and looked like something a football player would wear. the little ruffled flower pieces were random at the top and stuck out in all the wrong directions. it wasn't as elegant as the model pic (is it ever?) and for this price should fit like a glove. went back within seconds. also  it's pretty short  and bulky short isn't flattering on too many people.,Jackets
-1,"I might be the only odd person out there who think this jacket is not perfect at all. a lot of other reviewers said that the jacket runs small. for me  it's not true at all  i had to go to xxp petite to find the fit acceptable  but it was simply too short (rather than 20"" as it states on the website  it's more like 18"")  which is a thing i almost never experienced because i am a petite person! i don't even want to go regular size because it would've been too big. i saw some photos that others po",Jackets
-1,Does not look like the picture. lined with a cheap denim fabric inside that shows when arms are rolled up. i normally always fit in mediums and this jacket is so small in the arms as well as body that it fit like a xs.,Jackets
-1,This is a beautiful vest. i love the color-blocking  the modern and structured style  and its versatility.  i bought it with a defective item discount because there were some stains. i promptly took it to the dry cleaners and was informed that the black would bleed onto the white paneling if they did a full wash. they spot-cleaned it  and it did bleed. although the tag says to dry clean this baby  the black dye will bleed to the white fabric. i'll be taking it back into the store today for a ref,Jackets
-1,I wanted this jacket to fit on me like in the photo  but i guess my frame was still to petite. the fabric was also on the cheap end,Jackets
-1,I'm returning this jacket. i tried it on after it was delivered  and was happy with the weight  cut  and color  although it's more dusty mauve than it looks in the picture. however  the stitching and the zipper are of such poor quality that i doubt  it will last very long. i actually can't get the zipper to zip at all. it's very rough and lightweight  and i'm afraid if i keep trying to force it i'll just end up breaking it. sorry to say yet another retailer item turns out to be poor quality.   thi,Jackets
0,The fit is quite strange on me as the tie is very high on the waist. this makes the jacket look odd and quite voluminous. i was very impressed with the fabric though but will have to return. i wish retailer would post what size is the model wearing. maybe she is wearing a larger size than usual which falls lower.,Jackets
0,This is a very pretty jacket. light weight and perfect for spring/fall. i had ordered it online as it was not in my retailer store. i did end up returning it though. it does run large  i am usually a l/xl and based on previous reviews i did size down and get the l. the pockets for me were a little big an pushed out having an unflattering look! i was sad to have to send this one back! i was hoping to love it! someone smaller might love it!!,Jackets
0,Has i read the reviews would have realized the t-shirt looking sleeves in the pic are attached to the sweater. based on the pic and site description i didnt realize they were attached. i thought it was part of the styling of the undershirt. i think this very much limits the versatility of the sweater. i ordered the white which is a beautiful color and very soft. i am returning it cause i do not like the t-shirt sleeve. would rather have the flexibility to layer whatever shirt i wanted,Jackets
0,I had such high hopes for this jacket based on the photo  i even waited for it to come back in stock. the detail is beautiful but it is shapeless and boxy. for reference i ordered xs  and i am usually a 0/2 on top (small chested). it might look better on someone with a larger chest but looked like a sack on me. so disappointing.,Jackets
0,This jacket is cozy  warm  and very cute  but after the 1st washing (according to the manufacturer's instructions) it began to pill and has worsened each time.,Jackets
0,I'm 5'6''   athletic build-thought it was cute but in the end didn't like the color of the inner sweatshirt--wish it was black or white. send it back.,Jackets
0,Gorgeous  but the trim detail on both in-store coats was already trashed and falling apart. for $218 and it can't even make it out of the store intact? i love the look but didn't want it to fall apart. they should've done an extra reinforcing stitch on the trim. such a shame!!,Jackets
0,I was excited to see this offered by retailer because i have been looking for a light blue summer jacket or blazer that isn't a denim jacket and this seemed to fit the bill. i've ordered several cartonnier blazers in 00p  as early as 2013 and as late as spring 2015  and have been very happy with them. on the plus side i would say that the color is depicted accurately and it does seem like a high quality jacket. but while the shoulders and sleeves were a pretty standard fit for 00p  it was much too,Jackets
0,Was looking more for a tailored  blazer like chino jacket. this was just too bulky. usually wear a 00p  ordered the 00  and could have put a chunky sweater underneath. 5'4''  110 lbs  32c for reference.,Jackets
1,This is a beautiful jacket. the fabric is soft and drapes wonderful. truly a great addition to any staple in your wardrobe. i am having the sleeves shortened as i prefer a more 3/4 length.,Jackets
1,This beauty arrived in my store today...and despite all my gals telling me that i own too many vests  i just had to have this one. i've always wanted a cozy fur or sherpa vest...but i'm curvy and always feel like those add bulk. this one only has sherpa on one side (the softest most cozy sherpa ever) and its not too bulky! the print is even better than it appears online...in fact  the vest almost appears pink online  and its not in person. there is much more variation in color in person! i adore,Jackets
1,As other reviewers have pointed out  this jacket is way prettier in person than it is in the photos. i can wear it with just about anything. the fabric is soft and lightweight  and drapes really nicely. my only complaint is the photos make the taupe jacket look like it has just a hint of peach/mauve  but in person it's a pretty standard beige. i would have liked that hint of color.,Jackets
1,Unique vest: modern  chic. i especially like the color block one the collar part. i know it will become a staple in my working clothes  and i can also see it blend in to my weekend clothes. i don't think the back of this vest is of bad quality  like another reviewer said. overall it's a hight-quality piece.,Jackets
1,This vest is awesome. it can take any dress/outfit and instantly make it more fancy and formal. the way it drapes is very forgiving and the back bow can be modified and switched out for different colors depending on outfit color. .,Jackets
1,"This anorak is perfection! perfect weight  color  and the style is super easy to wear. i found this to fit true to size and not oversized at all. i'm 5""3  130lbs  32d with an average build/frame and i took a size small. i can comfortably wear a long sleeved shirt underneath or even a thin sweater. i think xs would have been too tight in the shoulders/bust. it fits perfectly and i love the inner drawstrings that you can pull to give it a little more shape. i got this during the 30% off promo!",Jackets
1,I absolutely love this jacket. as a 36 year old woman  i want items that are on trend but don't look juvenile. this jacket hits the nail on the head for me.,Jackets
1,Love this jacket!!! it is soooo soft and goes with everything. you will want to wear it every day. loved it so much i bought my mother one  too.,Jackets
1,I ordered this to go over a dress. i wanted the jacket short  to not cover the waist of the dress. on sale  i think it is a great bargain. the sleeves are long on me  but i rolled them  which i thought was intended since they are lined. the medium fit me. i am usually an 8 in tops. the ivory color is almost a pure white.,Jackets
-1,I've worn citizens for almost 12 years now  i keep going back because i have an athletic figure (my thighs and butt are bigger than my waist)  and usually citizens fit and hug all the right places and are made with a certain quality expectation - these did not meet any of those standards  the ripped as soon as i put them on. the material seemed cheap.,Jeans

-1,The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however  the fabric  despite 2% spandex  has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size 27 for 110 lb/5.4')  i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear  i think they would cut off the circulation.  please post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer.,Jeans
-1,These look nothing like the picture! they are super high-waisted & longer than they look in this picture. i felt as if i was wearing a pair of jeans from the 90's that just fit terribly. i thought they were going to be a pair of cropped wide legs & they are far from it. the color was also much lighter than shown in picture. super unflattering & just not for me. they're going back...,Jeans
-1,"If these jeans work for you  you're a lucky girl! the fabric is really thick and soft. pocket detail is cool and the hidden multicolored button placket is a nice detail. i ordered down a size. they're tight across my thighs and seem shorter than a 30"" inseam. the fit is boxy and not flattering on me but pants are so cute i may keep them anyway.",Jeans
-1,These are a beautiful color  but run large. i ordered my usual size and they are falling off of me. they are very low rise so i don't think i'll be trying the smaller size  can't even imagine them being lower. also  they are cropped  that's hard to tell in the picture.,Jeans

-1,I ordered these leggings and loved them  for about an hour- at which point the belt loop ripped off of the pant  leaving a hole. i called customer service and they sent me a 2nd pair. same thing happened. i never even pulled on the belt loop. they are just so flimsy. it's a shame bc they are cool looking.,Jeans

0,I was so glad to find such a beautiful item made in the usa. i knew the workmanship would be above average. the embroidery is gorgeous and makes these jeans so unique. i am usually a 24 in pilcro slouchy chinos  size 0 in most pants   25 in jeans so i ordered these in xs. the waist was at least 7-8 inches too large. they were enormous in every aspect of fit. no belt could possibly make these stay up. very disappointed . i would recommend an xs if you are a size 6 to 8.,Jeans
0,These are really nice pants - color and style are perfect but when i first put them on they seemed like they fit perfectly on me then within 30 minutes they looked 2 sizes too big - they got loose due to the material not being firm or thick enough. i would go down a size for sure. the cons aren't unsolvable so try them out!,Jeans
0,The design of these is adorable with the lace up ties however they are a dingy looking off white color. they are also pretty see through. returned.,Jeans
0,The color on these are amazing. i am 5'2 and these are really meant for that long lean profile. note they have very little stretch.,Jeans

1,These jeans immediately caught my eye online  and when i saw them in the store on display  i knew i had to at least try them on. they are absolutely adorable. i love the uniqueness of the buttons at the bottom. great fit  and great stretch. i wore them for the first time today  and i had at least four people i didn't know approach me and tell me that they liked my jeans.,Jeans
1,Morher jeans are my favourite! they are soft and fit great. make my saggy butt look good! they do stretch with wears but shrink again in the wash. they do shrink quite a bit so don't dry all the way! i recommend mother to all!,Jeans
1,I love these jeans. they are very comfortable and do not stretch excessively after wear. i found the cut to be very flattering and the material to be heavy enough to hold its shape while still having enough give to move around and chase after little ones. they look great paired with a v-neck and flats or cute blouses and heels. a great buy! like another reviewer i  too  found these ran a little small and went up a size.,Jeans

1,I honestly  have to give these jeans 5stars.  i loved them when i saw them in the store and had to have them and when i wore them  i got tons of compliments. they are super comfortable too!  i read some of the other reviews and thought that their comments were a little strange.  these jeans are obviously not classic and they will go of style but  if you run a little outside of the style box you will welcome them in your wardrobe.,Jeans
1,I was initially drawn to the shade of blue that these were as i was looking for a lighter late summer denim. after trying them on  i found that i did not want to take them off. they fit well and did not squeeze me anywhere. no muffin top as another reviewer noted. they are definitely a looser fit so size down. i probably could have even sized down again because i found them to stretch out after a while leaving a less flattering fit but certainly still s comfortable wear. absolutely worth a try!!,Jeans
1,"These jeans are worth every penny! they fit me perfectly as soon as i put them on  and i wore them the rest of the day! they are true to size with very generous stretch...if anything  i would size down. they feel durable  but not like typical denim. very soft. i am 5'3"" and about 117 or so  and my normal 25 fit like a dream. i did end up exchanging these because there was a small nick on the inside of the left thigh  and i was afraid they might tear right open. if the new pair comes without defe",Jeans

-1,I was debating getting a large in this top but went for the medium  boy is it huge  the jersey fabric is quite thick which makes the sleeves bulky and uncomfortable  even the small would be giant!   for reference i normally wear a size 8/10 my chest is 34 e and this was just so so huge  it hung so badly of my chest that it looked frumpy and made me look bigger than i am.  the colours are true and nice and vibrant... definitely size down with this one,Knits
-1,I bought this shirt after reading so many positive reviews. it looks much thinner and cheaper than the photo depicts.  like many reviewers have said  it does hit just above midriff but the fringe covers your belly.  it didn&#39;t hang right on me and i felt like i was wearing a rug.,Knits

0,This is an average top. i thought it would be a good work shirt (my office is very causal)  but it was just too loungey looking. fit is true to size. the fabric is thin- a little see through. not worth $108 in my opinion. i returned it.,Knits

-1,Wow! this sure is close fitting  as in suction cups to your body! yikes  definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me  it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it  not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs  it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.,Layering
-1,This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however  like a previous reviewer  the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted  without all the excess fabric at the bottom  it would have been perfect. again  the color  the lace  the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came,Layering

0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering

(i am 5 foot 1.5 inches  adn 115 lbs)    so the petite fit  but i still felt like the swing was a lot of fabric for me. classic cut  snug on the chest so i wouldn't be able to wear a sweater underneath. overal  i did like but decided to returrn it,Outerwear
-1,I loved these pants and purchased them in three colors. like another reviewer  within a few weeks  having worn them no more than a couple of times  the fabric in the crotch area started to wear thin and two pairs developed holes. i was not hard on the pants - just wore them to the office - and line dried them. so disappointing  as i really did love the pants. total waste of money.,Pants

-1,This one didn't work for me. there is no zipper  you climb into it from the very large neck hole. it was very low cut and the shoulders kept sliding off but the bottom half fit snug. the tie and waist seam didn't hit at my waist but the largest part of my middle. i tried other belts and it wasn't much better. the fabric and print were great. i love jumpers but this one went back.,Pants

0,This romper fits well and is flattering. i love the relaxed style. the quality is quite poor  though. one leg ripped the second time i wore it and the fabric  while soft and comfortable  is fraying and pilling like crazy. after only two brief wears  the romper looks cheap and old. i expect much better quality at this pricepoint. really disappointed.,Shorts

1,This romper is absolutely gorgeous. the embroidery is detailed and lovely and the fit is feminine and flattering. it's super versatile and easy to dress up or dress down depending where you want to wear it. i'm in love!   it is a little on the sheer side  though  and i chose to wear a tank top underneath for more coverage  but this was an easy fix. it was a reasonable trade off to wear a camisole under in exchange for the lightweight and flowy material. totally obsessed.,Shorts
1,The fabric is beautiful.  didn't wrinkle so much after 8 hours in a suitcase.  as opposed to the other reviewer mine arrived neatly  stripes match nicely.  i am kind of thick waisted and the size 6 was still perfect for me - i am currently 130 lbs  34-28-35.  love the colors and the fabric  a nice cotton twill  lined  pockets  pretty bow belt.  i am not a fan of the size zipper style but it is not a deal breaker.  glad i have them !!,Shorts

-1,As the other reviewer said  the skirt had this weird bunching on both sides of the hips-it was ridiculous. i don't know how anyone could wear it-looks like you had two little triangle things poking out from each hip. i'm long and lean so usually skirts like this fit me well. very very strangely constructed-i couldn't keep it even at the deeply discounted price,Skirts

1,After surviving the winter months in various combo's of flannel and wool  i was craving something feminine to wear for lounging and sleeping while traveling the mediterranean with a friend. this little gown looked ideal. the lace is very feminine  and smoother than i feared. i reserved a single star over concern that the jersey knit of the body won't hold up to the test of time. it is not sheer  rather just opaque enough so i won't be self conscious. the curved  high waist is flattering. regardi,Sleep

-1,I ordered this 3 months ago  and it finally came off back order. a huge disappointment. the fit wasn&#39;t so much the issue for me. the quality of the wool is subpar. someone else mentioned a &quot;felted wool&quot;...i guess  is that what you call it?  it does literally feel like felt! super thin  itchy  doesn&#39;t drape very well  and feels cheap (made in china). i got it on sale  but still not worth what i paid. definitely going back.,Sweaters

-1,I bought this suit based on the great reviews. i was so bummed when i tried it on. the top fit so well but the bottom kept bunching up. my torso is on the longer side so maybe that's why the bottoms keep coming up. every time i pulled the shorts down  the top would come down too  and vice versa. i am 5'5 and 120lbs and bought a 2 which is my normal size. i did like that the top had a bit of padding but that's the extent of what i liked about it. i will be returning it.,Swim

0,First  this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look.   however  there are several items to note. primarily  this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves.,Trend
0,Like a previous reviewer mentioned the jeans do not necessarily look like the one in the photo. i first ordered them in my regular size and also had to notice that they are cut like men's jeans with legs so skinny that i could only force them over my calves. the embroiding is beautiful  but it also stops the material from stretching  so the the super skinny legs are a real problem. also  they are not as intensely stone washed as shown in the picture. i decided to order them again one size bigger,Trend
